# inat2wiki - new

inat2wiki (hosted at https://inat2wiki.toolforge.org) is an application to connect observations from iNaturalist to Wikimedia Commons.

This repository is a slow rewrite of the tool, covering core functionality and making sure proper tests/documentation/internationalization/etc is in place.
